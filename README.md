## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Deep Learning model for sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset.

The model classifies reviews as Positive or Negative by learning contextual patterns and word dependencies in text data. Advanced regularization techniques such as Dropout, L2 Regularization, Early Stopping, and Learning Rate Scheduling are incorporated to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.

A Streamlit web application is also included for real-time sentiment prediction on custom user reviews.
